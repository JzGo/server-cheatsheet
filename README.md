# Server Cheatsheet

Server Cheatsheet is a hopeful name for this repo. I want to try to code up some simple 'Hello World' servers using different languages and libraries. I want to explore the ecosystem really and I thought this would be a fun and interesting way to do that.

Explored so far:

- [Ruby + Sinatra](./ruby-sinatra)
- [Node](./js-node)
- [Express](./js-express)
